# GalacticWarfare
## Purpose

The Galactic Warfare is a game that I made during the second year at university. The application was designed to be a replica of the Space Invaders game.

## Technology used

The application was developed using Java and LibGDX framework.

## Features 

The game has only one level. The spaceship can be moved using WASD keys and with SPACE key the player can shoot at the enemies. If the spaceship torches the enemies the game is lost.
